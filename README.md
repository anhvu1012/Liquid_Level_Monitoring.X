This project is about water level monitoring and involves the use of:

      1. Atmega328P
      2. Ultrasonic sensor in capture mode (self-developed shield)
      3. PT100 temperature sensor
      4. TFT display
      5. LED in PWM mode.

The ultrasonic sensor was responsible for the distance measurement and the temperature sensor for the water temperature measurement. The TFT display displayed the measurement data using shapes and colors. The illuminated LED was a signal that the level was high.
